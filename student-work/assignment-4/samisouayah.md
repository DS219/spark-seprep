Hi, my name is Sami Souayah, and I love coding in pythong because of how easily interpreted it is, and how conducive it is to coding new and interesting things on the fly.

## Example Code
````` def hello(x):
        count = 1
        x+=1
        for i in range(1,x):
            count*=i
        return count
`````
### Code explanation
This code takes an input x, and calculates the factorial of that digit.
