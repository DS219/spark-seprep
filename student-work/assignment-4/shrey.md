My favorite programming language is Python because it's simple and versatile.

## Example code

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

### Code Explanation

This is a simple function that takes a name and returns a greeting. Run it with `python filename.py`.
