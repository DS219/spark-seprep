# Sun Cho

Hi, my name is Sun Cho!
My favorite programming language is Python because there are various machine learning libraries such as sklearn, pytorch, and tensorflow that are helpful for building ML models

## Example Code

"""

def greet_users(names):

    for name in names:
        print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Python.")

users = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

greet_users(users)

"""

### Code Explanation

This code creates a "greeting machine" that takes a list of names—Alice, Bob, and Charlie—and automatically prints a personalized welcome message for each one. To run it, simply paste the code into an online Python compiler (like Programiz or Replit) and click Run to see the messages appear instantly in the output window.
