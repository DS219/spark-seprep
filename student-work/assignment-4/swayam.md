#swayam

Greetings I am Swayam and my favourite programming language is Java as I like how structured it was and how rigidly it abided by rules. It was also the first programming language that I learned.

##Example code
``` system.output.println('lol')
```

###Code Explanation
Copy and paste this code into an IDE or .py file and it will just print out the word lol
