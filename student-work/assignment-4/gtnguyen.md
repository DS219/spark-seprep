My favorite programming language is JavaScript because it allows me to build interactive and dynamic web experiences. I enjoy how it connects directly with HTML and CSS to bring websites to life. I also like how it can be used on the frontend and the backend.

## Example Code

```javascript
function calculateTotal(price, taxRate) {
    return price + price * taxRate;
}

const total = calculateTotal(50, 0.08);
console.log(`Total price: $${total}`);
```

### Code Explanation
This script defines a function that calculates the total cost of an item including tax. It takes a price and tax rate as input and returns the final amount. To run it, save the file as total.js and execute it in the terminal using node total.js
