Hi! my favorite programming language is Python given its easy to learn syntax and it usability. Python was my first language and it basically introduced me to the field of computer science.



## Example Code
```python
def fizz_buzz(input):
    if(input % 3 ==0) and (input % 5 == 0):
        return "FizzBuzz"
    elif input % 3 == 0:
        return "Fizz"
    elif input % 5 == 0:
        return "Buzz"
    return  input

### Code Explanation

A solution to the infamous fizzbuzz leetcode question where if an input is divisible by both 3 and 5 return FizzBuzz, if only divisible by 3 return Fizz and if only divisible by 5 return Buzz. Otherwise return the number.
