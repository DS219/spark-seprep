I'm a sophomore at BU studying data science. Im learning R right now. It is for statistical analysis and visualization.

## Code
```r
data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mean(data)
```

### Code Explanation

This snippet creates a simple numeric vector and calculates its mean using R's built-in `mean()` function. To run it, open RStudio or any R console and paste the code.
