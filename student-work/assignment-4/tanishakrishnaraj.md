Hi! My favorite programming language is probably Python because it was the first programming langauge I learnt and its very intuitive. However, I don't use it that much anymore.
## Example code
```class LinkedList():
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

    def append(self, other):
        self.next = other```
### Code explanation
This is a linked list class that helps create a linked list data structure.
