# Thu Vo

My favorite programming language is python, because I feel most comfortable withit. It was the first language I learned so it has a soft spot in my heart.

## Example Code

```
def roast_bedtime(hour):
    if hour <= 9:
        return "🌟 In bed by 9? You're either a legend or 80."
    elif hour <= 11:
        return "😊 Reasonable. Your future self approves."
    elif hour <= 1:
        return "😬 Past midnight? Bold choice, champ."
    elif hour <= 3:
        return "🔥 3am? What are you even doing with your life."
    else:
        return "💀 You didn't sleep. You just closed your eyes for a bit."
```

### Code Explanation

This function takes the hour you went to bed as a number (0–23) and returns a funny roast based on how late it was. The later you stayed up, the harsher the roast.:
