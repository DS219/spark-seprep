My favorite programming language is Python, because python is the most widely used programming language in the world.
## Example code
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```
### Code Explanation
#### What it does
- `range(1, 6)` generates numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
- The for loop sets i to each number in that sequence.
- `print(i)` prints each number on its own line.
#### How to run
- Make sure python environment is installed.
- Save the script to `loop.py`.
- In command line, type: `python loop.py`.
