# Lam Tran

My favorite programming language is python, since its the first one i learnt and it's very easy to utilize. Additionally, it caries a lot of my most used frameworks such as NumPy, Pandas or PyTorch.

## Example Code
```
def greet_and_count(name: str) -> int:
    print(f"Hi, {name}!")
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, 4):
        total += i
    print("Sum 1..3 =", total)
    return total
```

### Code Explanation

This function will print a greeting using the name you pass in, then it will calculate the sum of the numbers 1 through 3 (which is 6), print that result, and return 6.
To run it, copy the function into a file like greet.py, add a line at the bottom calling it for example greet_and_count("Lam"), then run it from the terminal with python3 greet.py. You need to have Python installed to run this program.
