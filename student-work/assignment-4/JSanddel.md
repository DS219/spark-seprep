My favorite programming langauge has to be Java. It has more security than python and there is a lot you can do with it in Software Engineering (it is used by almost all fortune 500 companies!)

##My Code 

```Public class HelloWorld{ 
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}

### Code explanation 

This is just one of the first few things you learn in Java. Hello World is a classic and everybody starts off with that :p
