Hi! My favorite programming language is Python because it is easy to read and widely used in data science and engineering applications.

## Example Code

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

### Code Explanation

This function defines a simple greeting function that takes a name as input and returns a formatted greeting string. 

To run the code:
1. Save the file as example.py
2. Open a terminal
3. Run: python example.py
