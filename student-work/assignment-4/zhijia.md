# Zhijia

Hi, my name is Zhijia Yang and my favorite programing language is Python because it's easy-reading and straightforward!

## Example code

```python
import random

jokes = ["There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don't.","Why did the programmer quit his job? Because he 
didn't get arrays.","I'm not lazy, I'm just in energy-saving mode.","Debugging: Removing the needles from the haystack."]

print(random.choice(jokes)))
```

### Code explanation

This script prints one random quote each time you run it.You can save the code to a file named jokes.py and cd to this into the folder which contains jokes.py 
in the terminal. Then, after running 'python3 jokes.py' in the terminal, you can see one of the quote in the jokes.
