# Rianna James

Hi, my name is Rianna James and my favorite programing language is python because it's simple and easy to understand.

## Example code

```
for i in range(10):
	if (i % mod 2) == 0:
		print("I'm an even number <3 :", i)

```

### Code explanation

This script will display even numbers from 0-9.
