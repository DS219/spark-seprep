# Samuel Lee

Hi, my name is Samuel Lee and my favorite programming language is Python because it is simple and readable for data science.

## Example code

```python
import random

jokes = [
    "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.",
    "Why did the programmer quit? Because he didn't get arrays.",
    "Debugging is like being a detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer."
]

print(random.choice(jokes))

### Code Explanation

This Python script selects and prints one random joke each time
