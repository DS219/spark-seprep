# Yeongchan Jang

Hi, my name is Yeongchan. My favorite programming language is Python because it is versatile, readable, and widely used in data science and AI.

## Example code

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

### Code Explanation

This function defines a simple greeting function that takes a name as input and returns a formatted string.\
To run the code, save it as a Python file and execute it using `python filename.py` in the terminal.
