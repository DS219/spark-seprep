# Jo'vonte Witter

Hi, my name is Jo'vonte Witter and my favorite programming language is Python because it is easy to read and is great for data science.

## Example code

```python
import random
jokes = [
    "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.",
    "There are 10 types of people: those who understand binary and those who don’t."
]
print(random.choice(jokes))
```
### Code Explanation
This script stores a list of programming jokes and prints one random joke each time you run it.
To run this code:
1. Save the file as `jokes.py`
2. Open a terminal
3. Run:
```
python jokes.py
```
