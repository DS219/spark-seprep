# Danaid Sinani

Hi, my name is Danaid Sinani and my favorite language is python because it is really easy to learn and read.

## Example Code

```
import random

choices = ['rock','paper','scissors]

user = str(input("Pick rock,paper or scissors))
computer = random.choice(choices)

if user == 'computer':
    print('tie')
elif (user == 'rock' and computer =='scissors') or
     (user == 'paper' and computer == 'rock') or
     (user == 'scissors' and computer =='paper')):
    print('you win')
else:
    print('you lose')
```

### Code Explanation

This script plays rock paper scissors, you against the computer. To run from the terminal, make sure you have python/python3 on your machine, copy the above to `game.py` and run it with `python3 game.py`. You need to have Python installed [Python install Documentation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
