Hi, my name is Dhiraj Patel, and my favorite programming language is Python because I love its simple syntax and amazing libraries for machine learning!

## Example code

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Code explanation

This script will print "Hello, World!" to the console when it is run. To run the code, place it in a .py file (ex. hello.py) and in the terminal, type `python3 hello.py`.
