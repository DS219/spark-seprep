# Mohammed Alhashmi

Hi, I’m Mohammed (mohdsh4). My favorite programming language is **Python** because it feels natural to write in and doesn’t get in the way. The syntax is clean, I don’t have to write a lot of boilerplate, and it has libraries for almost anything I want to do—especially data science and AI.

## Example code
```python
def greet(name: str) -> None:
    print(f"Salam, {name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greet("DS219")
