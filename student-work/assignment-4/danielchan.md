# Daniel Chan

Hi Everyone! My name is Daniel Chan, and my favorite programming language is Python because its syntax is simple and it has a wide range of applications. Everything from web scraping with the BeautifulSoup library to building AI models with TensorFlow relies on it.

## Example Code
```
import random
import math

num = random.uniform(0, 100)
rounded_num = math.ceil(num)
print("Random number (rounded up):", rounded_num)

```

### Code Explanation
The code imports two libraries: random and math. It generates a random floating-point number between 0 and 100, rounds it up to the nearest whole number using math.ceil(), and then prints the result. You can run the code by saving it as a .py file and then typing python filename.py in a terminal, which will execute it and print the result. However, you need python installed or else the computer won't know how to run it. See [Python install documentation](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
