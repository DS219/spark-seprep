I love using Python because it’s powerful, easy to learn, and has libraries for almost anything in data science.

## Example code

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))

### Code Explanation

This Python code defines a simple function `greet` that returns a greeting for the name you pass in. When you run it, it prints “Hello, World!”.
