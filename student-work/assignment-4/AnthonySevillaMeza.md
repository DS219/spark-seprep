# Anthony Sevilla-Meza

Hi, my name is Anthony and my favorite programing language is python because I love how easy it is to understand!

## Example code

```
import time

def dad_joke():
    	p1 = "Why don’t skeletons ever fight each other?"

    	p2 = "They don’t have the guts."
    	return p1, p2
if __name__ == "__main__":
	p1, p2 = dad_joke()
	print(p1)
	time.sleep(2)
	print(2)

```

### Code explanation

This script will display a dad joke with a short pause each time you run it.

To run it from the terminal, copy the code into a file called `dad_joke.py` and run it with: python dad_joke.py.

You need to have Python installed. See [Python installation documentation](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
