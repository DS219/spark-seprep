# Tanu Pendeti
Hi! My name is Tanu Pendeti. I'm a first year student studying Data Science and Business here at Boston University. My favorite programming language would have to be python because of how easy it is to pick up and its similarity to English. 

## Example Code
```python
def name():
	print("My name is Tanu")
name()
```

### Code Explanation
The function in Python prints "My name is Tanu" when run and is named the "name" function.
