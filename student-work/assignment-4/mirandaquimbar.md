# Miranda Quimbar

Hi, my name is Miranda, and my favorite programming language is Python. I think it's the most intuitive and you can do a lot with it!

## Example code
```
def fun():
    for i in range(5):
        print("This is so fun!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    fun()
```

### Code explanation

Calling this function will print out "This is so fun!" 5 times, because it's so fun! To run this from the terminal copy the above to a `fun.py` and run it with `python fun.py`.
