# Gayoung Ko

Hi, my name is Gayoung Ko and my favorite programming language is R because it makes data visualization simple. 

## Example code
```r
# Approximation of Euler's number e
n <- 10000
almost_e <- (1 + 1 / n) ^ n
almost_e

### Code Explanation

This code approximates the mathematical constant *e* using the formula. To run this code, copy the lines directly into RStudio's Console and press Enter. 
Alternatively, save this code to a file with a `.R` extension (e.g., `gayoung.R`) and execute it from the terminal with `Rscript gayoung.R`.
