My favorite programming language is Python. I like it because it is explicit and I have been using it the most.

## Example code

```python
import random

jokes = ["Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!",
         "How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? None, that's a hardware problem."]

print(random.choice(jokes))
```

### Code Explanation

This code prints a random joke from a list. Run it with `python filename.py`.
