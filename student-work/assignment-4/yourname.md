Hi my name is Tatum and my favorite programming language is SQL because it looks nice.
```SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';```
This SQL query retrieves all records from the `employees` table where the employee works in the Sales department. To run this code, you need access to a SQL database system like MySQL or SQL lite.
