My favourite programming language is Java, I really enjoyed object oriented programming with Java as opposed to with python. I enjoyed treating everything as objects and classes and I thought that Java had very logical syntax and rules.

## Example code

```

private static int calculateSum(int n) {
      int sum = 0;
      for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
         sum += i;
      }
      return sum;
   }
```

## Code explanation

This method should take an integer n and return the sum of all integers from 1 up to n, inclusive.
