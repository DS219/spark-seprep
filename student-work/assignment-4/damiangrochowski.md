# Damian Grochowski

Hello, my name is Damian Grochowski and my favorite programming language is Python because of its data analysis abilities!

## Example Code

```python
def mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
print(mean(data))
```

### Code Explanation

This code defines a function called mean that takes a list of numbers and returns their average. It does this by summing all the values in the list and dividing by the length of the list. You can run this code by copying it and putting it in a .py file, then running python mean.py in your terminal.
