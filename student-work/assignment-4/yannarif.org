My name is yann and my favorite language is C due to the transparency,
speed and control it offers the user.

** Example Code

#+begin_src <C>
  int main(int argc, int* argv[]) {
    char[6] course = "DS219";
    printf("Hello World\n");
    printf("This is sample code for %s\n",course);
  }
#+end_src

*** Code Explanation

compile this code using ~gcc -o <binname> <srcfile.c>~ and run the binary
