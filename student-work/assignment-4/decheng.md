Hi, my name is Decheng. I'm a senior majoring CS at Boston University. My favorite programming language is Python because of it's versatility and simplicity. 

## Example Code
```
def is_even(num):
	return num % 2 == 0
```

### Code Explanation 
The function above checks if a given num input is even by returning true if even and false if odd. To run the code, simply call the function with a number and run/execute its file.
