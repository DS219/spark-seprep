# Eddie

My favorite programming language is Go. I just started learning it recently but its handling of concurrency with goroutines and how fast it compiles for distributed systems projects is exciting for me. It's a little bit of recency bias too, since I'm just starting on it lol.

# Example code

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
	message := "Hello, this is Eddie in Go!"
	fmt.Println(message)
}
```

### Code Explanation
The code above is just a simple Go program that includes the basic structure of a Go file (package declaration, imports, and a main()), using the 'fmt' package to print out my message!
