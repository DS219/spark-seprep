# Nora Amer  
Hello! My name is nora, i'm a third-year undergrad studying data science and public health! my favorite programming language is probably python... I think that its very easy to use (all the work is technically done for me...) and it is pretty versatile. 

## example code

```python
import pyjokes
joke = pyjokes.get_joke()
print(joke)
```
