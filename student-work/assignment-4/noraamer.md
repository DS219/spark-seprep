Hello! My name is nora, i'm a third-year undergrad studying data science and public health! my favorite programming language is probably python... I think that its very easy to use (all the work is technically done for me...) and it is pretty versatile. 

## example code

```
import pyjokes

joke = pyjokes.get_joke()
print(joke)
```

### code explanation 
this is a very simple application of a package available to use in python where there is a library of jokes in pyjokes, and you can call the function from the package to get a joke, and then print it to get your joke!
