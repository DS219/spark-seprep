#Ola Szulska
Hi, my name  is Ola and my Favourite programming language is Python because it's simple and widely used for data science.

##Example code 
```python
import random

jokes = ["Why don’t skeletons fight each other?They don’t have the guts.",
"Why did the computer go to therapy?It had too many bytes of trauma.",
"Why can’t your nose be 12 inches long?Because then it’d be a foot",
"Why did the math book look so sad?It had too many problems.",
"Why did the coffee file a police report?It got mugged."]

print(random.choices(jokes))

##Code explanation
This code will display one random joke each time you run it.
Save the code in a file names jakoes.py and run python jokes.py in a terminal.
