My favorite programming language is Python. I love using Python for data analysis and visualization.

## Example Code

```python
import random
jokes = [
    "Why do programmers hate nature? It has too many bugs.",
    "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!",
    "A fish with no eyes is called fsh."
]
print(random.choice(jokes))
```

### Code Explanation

This script prints one random programming joke each time it runs. Save it as jokes.py and run.
