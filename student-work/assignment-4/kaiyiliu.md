My favorite programming language is Python because its clean syntax, massive ecosystem (NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch), and great tooling make it fast to prototype ideasâ€”especially for deep learning and data science.

## Example Code
```
from math import sqrt

def rms(values):
    """Root-mean-square of a list of numbers."""
    n = len(values)
    return sqrt(sum(x*x for x in values) / n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    print("RMS:", rms(xs))
```
### Code Explanation
The code defines a small rms function to compute the root-mean-square of a list, then runs it on [1,2,3,4,5]. Saving the code as rms.py, and run python rms.py in terminal. You must have python environment set up.
