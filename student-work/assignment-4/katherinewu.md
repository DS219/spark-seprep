# Katherine Wu


My name is Katherine Wu, and my favorite programming language is Python because it is user friendly and intuitive. 


## Example code


```
yob = int(input("What year were you born? "))
print(f"You are turning or turned {2026-yob} in 2026.")
```


### Code explanation


This code takes the user's input as a number, the year they were born. It then computes how old they will turn or how old they have turned in the current year, 2026. To run from the terminal, copy the above to `age.py` and run it with `python3 age.py`. You should have Python and Python3 installed.
